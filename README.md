# Amortized Bayesian Workflow

This repository contains the code for the article [*Amortized Bayesian Workflow*](https://openreview.net/forum?id=osV7adJlKD). The article introduces an amortized Bayesian workflow for accelerating Bayesian posterior computation, built around three main steps: (1) amortized posterior draws, (2) Pareto-smoothed importance sampling, and (3) many-chains MCMC with amortized initializations.

For the original workflow implementation and the scripts used in the article’s experiments, see [this branch](https://github.com/pipme/amortized-Bayesian-workflow/tree/code-submission). The main branch is reserved for an updated, more user-friendly implementation of the amortized Bayesian workflow.
